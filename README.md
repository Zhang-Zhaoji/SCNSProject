# SCNSProject

This Repository is for Tsinghua's Term Project **Problem-Based-Learining-3** of SCNS2025: Allen Brain Observatory-Vision Neural Information Decoding & Exploration.

## Current status:

0. Data-Reading Framework: **Almost there**, needs further Implementation
1. Tunning: **Almost there**, needs More Images and more diverse analysis in the future
2. Decoding: **Fixed logistic model**. Add methods for classification via clustering and dimensionality reduction. 
3. Modeling-Think like Hubel and Wiesel: **Implementing**. We implemented a simple forward model and want to do more things based on it, including Mutual information, Causality and ~~CCG~~(expired).
